    <h2>Flask Python Framework Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.
    </p>
    <p>
        It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. It is a WSGI web app framework.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Web Framework?</h3>
    <p>
        A Web Application Framework or simply a Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enable web application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level details such as protocol, thread management, and so on.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Flask?</h3>
    <p>
        Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, who led a team of international Python enthusiasts called Pocco. Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.
    </p>

    <h4>WSGI</h4>
    <p>
        The Web Server Gateway Interface (Web Server Gateway Interface, WSGI) has been used as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is the specification of a common interface between web servers and web applications.
    </p>

    <h4>Werkzeug</h4>
    <p>
        Werkzeug is a WSGI toolkit that implements requests, response objects, and utility functions. This enables a web frame to be built on it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeg as one of its bases.
    </p>

    <h4>Jinja2</h4>
    <p>
        Jinja2 is a popular template engine for Python. A web template system combines a template with a specific data source to render a dynamic web page.
    </p>

    <h3>Microframework</h3>
    <p>
        Flask is often referred to as a microframework. It is designed to keep the core of the application simple and scalable. Instead of an abstraction layer for database support, Flask supports extensions to add such capabilities to the application.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is Flask a good web framework choice?</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because it doesn’t have a huge learning curve.
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app, you only need a few lines of code.
    </p>
    <!-- Add "Hello World" code example here -->
    <p>
        If you want to develop on your local computer, you can do so easily. Save this program as server.py and run it with python server.py.
    </p>
    <!-- Add local development and online hosting instructions here -->
    <p>
        Flask is one of the most popular web frameworks, meaning it’s up-to-date and modern. You can easily extend its functionality. You can scale it up for complex applications.
